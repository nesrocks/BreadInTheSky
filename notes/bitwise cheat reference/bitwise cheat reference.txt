// XOR //
Description: Flip bits (flips a bit using a 1 bit and copy the bit using a 0 bit)
Operator: ^
Example:
    0101
XOR 0011
  = 0110
Verbose explanation: Flips specific bits by XORing with a number that is only zeroes except for the bit(s) you want flipped.


// AND //
Description: Turn off bits (turn off using a 0 bit and copy the bit using a 1 bit)
Operator: &
Example:
    0101
AND 0011
  = 0001
Verbose explanation: The second number's 1 bits act as a mask to the first number's bits.


// OR //
Description: turn on bits (turn on using a 1 bit, and copy the bit using a 0 bit)
Operator: |
Example:
   0101
OR 0011
 = 0111
Verbose explanation: This "adds" the bits together. It combines both numbers so that everything becomes 1, except when both are 0.

// << or >> bitshift
Example:
8 << 1 = 16
